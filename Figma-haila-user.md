## Project Description:
This project involves a collaborative effort between two individuals: a user and a designer. Each participant takes turns assuming the role of the user and the designer, respectively. The objective is to create a website based on the user's idea and requirements, and then reverse the process.

## Tools:
- **Figma:** Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that allows real-time collaboration between team members. It enables seamless design collaboration, prototyping, and feedback gathering.

### Key Requirements:
- The website must consist of at least three pages.
- The homepage should include three main sections in addition to the navbar and footer.

### Fidelity Levels:
- **Low Fidelity:** Basic wireframes or sketches outlining the website's layout and structure.
- **High Fidelity:** Detailed designs with visual elements, colors, and typography.

## How to Use:
1. **User Role:**
   - The user presents their website idea and provides detailed requirements to the designer.
   - Collaborate with the designer to ensure the vision is accurately translated into the design.

2. **Designer Role:**
   - Create the website design based on the user's specifications.
   - Offer different fidelity levels (low and high) for the user to choose from.
   - Iterate on the design based on user feedback.

3. **Switching Roles:**
   - Once the designer completes the design, switch roles, and repeat the process with the user becoming the designer and vice versa.

## Collaboration with Haila as User:

### User: Haila
- Haila will provide the website idea and detailed requirements.
- Collaborate with Haila to understand her vision and preferences.
- Offer feedback and suggestions to ensure the design aligns with Haila's expectations.

## Collaboration Guidelines:
- Provide constructive feedback to improve the design.
- Keep track of design iterations and document any changes made.
