# Design Thinking Project

## :information_source: Overview 

Welcome to our design thinking project repository! In this project, we explore the application of design thinking principles to create a personalized workspace for our client, Fahad. 
This README provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, process, and outcomes.

## :dart:Objective 

The objective of this project is to apply the principles of design thinking to understand Fahad's workspace needs and preferences, 
ideate various design solutions, and ultimately create a workspace solution that aligns with Fahad's requirements.

## :building_construction: Project Structure 

The project is structured into several key phases:

1. **Understanding Fahad's Needs**: Conduct research and interviews to gain insights into Fahad's work habits, preferences, and challenges.

2. **Ideation and Brainstorming**: Generate creative ideas and potential solutions to address Fahad's workspace requirements.

3. **Concept Development**: Refine and develop selected concepts into detailed design proposals.

4. **Implementation**: Execute the chosen design solution, incorporating feedback and adjustments as needed.

5. **Documentation and Presentation**: Document the project process and outcomes in a README file and prepare a presentation summarizing the project journey and final workspace design.
