# Coffee Shop Website Project - Design Thinking Approach

Welcome to our Coffee Shop Website project repository! This README provides an in-depth overview of our project, detailing our problem-solving journey using the design thinking methodology.

## Problem Identification

üîç **Problem Identification:**
Our project was born out of a keen observation within the coffee shop industry: a lack of personalized coffee options tailored to individual preferences and health requirements. We noticed that many coffee enthusiasts faced challenges in finding coffee that suited their specific taste preferences or accommodated their health concerns.

## Analysis and Evaluation

üìä **Analysis and Evaluation:**
To gain a deeper understanding of the problem, we undertook a thorough analysis and evaluation phase. This involved empathizing with our target audience, conducting extensive market research, and gathering insights from interviews and surveys. Through this process, we uncovered nuanced insights into our customers' needs and pain points.

## Define

üéØ **Define:**
With valuable insights at hand, we defined a clear problem statement to encapsulate the core challenges faced by our target audience. Our problem statement succinctly articulated the need for a coffee shop solution that offers customizable options to cater to diverse preferences and health considerations.

## Persona Creation

üë• **Persona Creation:**
To humanize our problem and better understand our target audience, we created detailed personas representing typical coffee enthusiasts with varying preferences and health needs. These personas, such as Abdullah and Mohammed, provided valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by different customer segments.

## Problem Evaluation

üîç **Problem Evaluation:**
With a well-defined problem statement and detailed personas, we critically evaluated the problem's significance and feasibility. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we validated the problem's prevalence and its potential impact on customer satisfaction and business success.

## Ideation and Solution Proposal

üí° **Ideation and Solution Proposal:**
Armed with a deep understanding of the problem, we embarked on an extensive ideation phase to brainstorm potential solutions. Through collaborative brainstorming sessions and creative exercises, we generated a wide range of innovative ideas aimed at addressing the identified challenges.

## Prototype Development

üñ•Ô∏è **Prototype Development:**
To bring our proposed solution to life, we developed interactive prototypes of the coffee shop website. These prototypes showcased the key features and functionalities envisioned for the final product. Through iterative refinement based on user feedback, we ensured that the final design effectively meets the needs of our target audience.

## Folder Structure

üìÅ **Folder Structure:**
Our project repository is structured as follows:

- `/research`: Contains research materials, including interviews, surveys, and data analysis reports.
- `/persona`: Includes detailed persona profiles representing typical coffee enthusiasts.
- `/ideation`: Houses ideation materials, such as brainstorming notes and concept sketches.
